# Notes

React app to write notes, or maybe in the future and with more functinality, blogs.

[Here](https://splendid-choux-3b3d35.netlify.app/) is the website for the project.

The project is hosted on netlify, the 'see more' button is not fully developed yet.
For now you can add a note and see it in the prompts page.

### `Future Implementations`

The text editor will have more functionality to control text. Bolding, italics, headers, etc..
Login/Logout functionality to have user specific posts. Image support and a complete overhaul of the UI.
